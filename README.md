in case my own Web-Server is down at 000webhosting, because it's free, for people with some **Coding Skills** how to maintain their own website, since October 2017 it goes to sleep for an hour every day unless you upgrade to a paid account ... argh, but, this one is always on, free w/ Git v.s that track &amp; saves all the previous changes in your **Code**, click here to see [LuisMiguel-Cv-Portfolio](https://linuxfce.github.io/LuisMiguel-Cv-Portfolio/) .

 I also design websites and blogs for free to my neighbours, check this one [Greenwich Flavoured Coffee](https://linuxfce.github.io/Greenwich-Flavoured-Coffee/index.html) and some of my Blogs samples [Miguel's Blog](https://linuxfce.github.io/joly-jekyll/) and this one [Meiras site](https://linuxfce.github.io/about/) .
 All the blogs where forked from [daattali/beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) .
 
 I'm also doing online coding lessons (HTML,CSS and JScript) at FreeCodeCamp, you can check my **Code CV** that I have already completed here [Luis Miguel T - Code lessons completed](https://www.freecodecamp.org/linuxfce) at FreeCodeCamp.

A Pen created by me at CodePen.io. You can find this one at [migLinux](https://codepen.io/migLinux/) .
