# LuisMiguel-Cv-Portfolio

## A backup website of my [CV-Portfolio Site](http://miguelpcrepairs.site90.net/) ##
in case my own Web-Server is down at 000webhosting, because it's free, for people with **Code Sills** how to maintain their own website, since October 2017 it goes to sleep for an hour every day unless you upgrade to a paid account ... argh

 I also design websites and blogs for free to my neighbours, check this one [Greenwich Flavoured Coffee](https://linuxfce.github.io/Greenwich-Flavoured-Coffee/index.html) and some of my Blogs samples [Miguel's Blog](https://linuxfce.github.io/joly-jekyll/) and this one [Meiras site](https://linuxfce.github.io/about/) .
 All the blogs where forked from [daattali/beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) .
 
 I'm also doing a online coding lessons at FreeCodeCamp, you can check my **Code CV** that I have already completed here [Luis Miguel T - Code lessons completed](https://www.freecodecamp.org/linuxfce) at FreeCodeCamp.

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at [migLinux](http://codepen.io/migLinux/pen/QgOwdx) .
